"""
Base interface for controlling the Quanser QArm in joint space.

Conventions:
- Joint order must be fixed and consistent between simulation and hardware
  implementations; document the chosen order when wiring up a concrete class.
- The default joint naming/ordering used across this repo is:
  ("yaw", "shoulder", "elbow", "wrist")
- All joint angles are expressed in radians.
- Students are expected to build their own forward and inverse kinematics on
  top of the joint-level commands defined here.
